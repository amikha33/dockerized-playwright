- **Create Docker Volume:** To create a Docker volume named local_reports_volume to store the reports generated by Playwright.


      docker volume create local_reports_volume
- **Build Docker Image:** To build a Docker image named playwright-tests using a Dockerfile.


      docker build -t playwright-tests .
- **Run Container and Generate Reports:** You run the playwright-tests container, mounting the local_reports_volume volume to the /app/playwright-report directory inside the container.
Inside the container, Playwright tests were executed, generating reports in the mounted volume.

      docker run --name playwright-tests -v local_reports_volume:/app/playwright-report playwright-tests

- **Copy Reports from Volume to Local Directory:** To copy the reports from the Docker volume to your local machine using the docker cp command.
However, you encountered some issues, likely because the container had already terminated, or the reports were not located where you expected.

 
      docker cp playwright-tests:/app/playwright-report .
